Dependency
==========
For Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

Plus the GCC tool chain.


Compiling
=========
To compile the hub-ctrl.c program run the following compile command.

    gcc -o hub-ctrl hub-ctrl.c -lusb -std=c99

That results in an executable binary called `hub-ctrl`.


Usage
=====

List hubs and ports (colour-coded in actual use):

    $ sudo ./hub-ctrl
    Hub 0 (Bus 1, Dev 4) - ganged power switching
     ├─ Port  1:  power
     ├─ Port  2:  power
     ├─ Port  3:  power connect enable
     ├─ Port  4:  power
     ├─ Port  5:  power highspeed connect enable
     ├─ Port  6:  power
     └─ Port  7:  power
    Hub 1 (Bus 1, Dev 2) - individual power switching
     ├─ Port  1:  power highspeed connect enable
     ├─ Port  2: 
     ├─ Port  3:  power highspeed connect enable
     ├─ Port  4:  power
     └─ Port  5:  power
    Hub 2 (Bus 1, Dev 1) - ganged power switching
     └─ Port  1:  power highspeed connect enable


Note [`H`ub number] or [`B`us number plus `D`evice number] and `P`ort number of your target port/device. To control its power:

    # use hub and port number to locate device/port
    #   -p 0 = off; 1 = on
    $ sudo ./hub-ctrl -H 0 -P 3 -p 0

or

    # use bus, device and port number to locate device/port
    $ sudo ./hub-ctrl -B 1 -D 4 -P 3 -p 0

A useful command to get more information of USB devices including hierarchy of chained USB hubs is:

    $ lsusb -t
    /:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=dwc_otg/1p, 480M
        |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/5p, 480M
            |__ Port 1: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=smsc95xx, 480M
            |__ Port 3: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/7p, 480M
                |__ Port 3: Dev 25, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M
                |__ Port 3: Dev 25, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M
                |__ Port 5: Dev 6, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 480M


Known Issues
============
- No validation of command-line arguments
- Some USB ports turn back on automatically after being turned off.


TODO
====
- Add device description/type in port status lines. This is particularly useful in identifying chained hubs so you don't accidentally turn off an entire hub by powering off the port that it connects to. See above output of `lsusb -t` for an example - turning off bus 1 port 3 dev 4 will kill the 7-port hub. This relationship isn't clear in the output of `sudo ./hub-ctrl`.
- Convert to python script as I'm more comfortable with it.
